# AgriConnect: A MERN Stack E-Farming Marketplace üöú

AgriConnect is a comprehensive web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) designed to modernize the farm-to-consumer supply chain. It provides a digital marketplace where local farmers can showcase their products, and consumers can browse and discover fresh, local produce.

The project was built from the ground up, starting from a design document and evolving into a feature-complete application with secure authentication, role-based access control, a full suite of management tools for both farmers and admins, and a professional, responsive user interface.
